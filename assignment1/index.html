        <p>Hello my name is Bryan Kenneweg. I am originally from San Diego California but been living in Austin Texas for over 10 years. Currently I work for Apple as a Customer Relations advisor with over 8 years of experience in my field. I have a vast background spanning from education all the way to sales with everything in between, however I always had a love for computing. With that, I am now currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp to pursue my goal of joining the developer community, as well as to hopefully become a junior developer in early 2017.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding, or teaching myself to code, I am spending time with my wife as well as my dogs at one of the endless places in Austin.</p>
